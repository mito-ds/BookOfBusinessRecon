# MyPlanAdvocate Provider Recon App

Need to check a new book of business against our salesforce data? This app makes it easy.

## Setting up Mito

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8-3.11 installed, installing [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/)
2. Open a Command Prompt. Use the command `cd change\to\path\to\this\folder` to navigate to this folder.
3. Run the command `setup.bat` -- this will either print "Setup completed successfully." or inform you of a setup error.

## Running this app

Now that everything is installed, run this app by:
1. Open a Command Prompt. Use the command `cd change\to\path\to\this\folder` to navigate to this folder.
2. Run the command `run.bat`

A new webpage should open -- and you should be able to use this to create and re-run automations.
